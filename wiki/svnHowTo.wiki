You need a svn client program to check out the source code for projects
hosted on http://code.google.com. Most Linux systems should already have svn
client installed and the following command should work:

{{{svn checkout http://gmmreg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gmmreg-read-only}}}

Windows users are recommended to use [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN]. For how to use TortoiseSVN, there is a nice [http://code.google.com/p/ulipad/wiki/SvnHowTo intrduction] by [http://code.google.com/u/limodou.project/ limodou], the author of [http://code.google.com/p/ulipad/ UliPad].

Note that the "URL of repository" for this project should be
  http://gmmreg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
