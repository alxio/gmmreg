This directory contains the C++ code for the robust point-set
registration algorithms described in the following two papers:

Bing Jian and Baba C. Vemuri:
A Robust Algorithm for Point Set Registration Using Mixture of Gaussians.
ICCV 2005, pp. 1246-1251.

Andriy Myronenko, Xubo B. Song, Miguel A. Carreira-Perpinan: 
Non-rigid point set registration: Coherent Point Drift. 
NIPS 2006, pp. 1009-1016


It is part of software package which can be freely downloaded from
http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/cvgmi/Software.php#gmmreg


This implementation requires the vxl/vnl library which can be downloaded
from http://vxl.sourceforge.net/

To build the execuatables from the source code, please use the cMake
which can be obained from http://www.cmake.org/
