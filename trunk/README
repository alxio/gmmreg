Description:
This program is an implementation of the tnon-rigid point set registration 
algorithm presented in the following ICCV'05 paper:
 
A Robust Algorithm for Point Set Registration Using Mixture of Gaussians, 
Bing Jian and Baba C. Vemuri,
10th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2005),
17-20 October 2005, Beijing, China, pp. 1246-1251.

Demos in Windows command line, MATLAB and Python are available:
1. Windows executable 
gmmreg_tps config.ini  
(please see the example ini files for details)

2. Matlab demo scripts
fish_demo.m   (2D example)
face_demo.m   (3D example)

3. Python demo scripts
import gmmreg
gmmreg.run('./fish_full.ini')
gmmreg.run('./fish_half.ini')
(matplotlib is required for plotting the point sets)

Note:
(1) Please write to bing.jian@gmail.com if you need the executable or matlab mexfile on Linux 
    or the python extension based on Python2.4
(2) Please address your questions to bing.jian@gmail.com. We welcome any comments or feedbacks 
    that may improve the program.
(3) Please make a proper citation to our ICCV'05 paper if you use this program in a scholarly work.
