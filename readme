This program is an implementation of the following ICCV'05 paper
 @INPROCEEDINGS{Jian&Vemuri_iccv05,
   author = {Bing Jian and Baba C. Vemuri},
   title = {A Robust Algorithm for Point Set Registration Using Mixture of Gaussians.},
   booktitle = {10th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2005),
     17-20 October 2005, Beijing, China},
   year = {2005},
   pages = {1246-1251}
 }
 
The current program supports quick demos running on command line, MATLAB or Python:

1. Windows executable 
gmmreg_tps config.ini  
(please see inside the included ini files for details)

2. Matlab demo scripts
fish_demo.m
face_demo.m

3. Python demo scripts
import gmmreg
gmmreg.run('./fish_full.ini')
gmmreg.run('./fish_half.ini')
(matplotlib is required for plotting the point sets)

Note:
(1) Please write to bing.jian@gmail.com if you need the executable or matlab mexfile on linux or the python extension based on Python2.4
(2) Please address your questions to bing.jian@gmail.com. We welcome any comments or feedbacks that may improve the program.
(3) Please make a proper citation to our ICCV'05 paper if you do use this program in your scholarly work.
